 ========

The author would like to devote this project to support the [Foundation Gastrostars](https://gastrostars.nl).

On the 01/10/2023 there are International Music Day and [André's Rieu](https://www.andrerieu.com/en) Birthday. So the version 0.11.0.0 is
additionally devoted to him as well as to the Kok family — [Emma](https://emmakok.nl) and [Enzo](https://enzokok.nl) are amazing and fantastic musicians, Vico
works with PhilZuid, Sophie sings in the classical manner. Nathalie Kok with love to her family and 
appreciation for André's Rieu support also celebrates the Day. In Ukraine this day has several 
important celebrations — Intercession of the Holy Theotokos (Pokrova), Cossacks' Day, Day of Defenders of Ukraine (especially relevant during the Russian war against Ukraine).

On the 21/02/2024 there is an International Mother Tongue Day — that is Ukrainian for the author of the package. 

All support is welcome, including donations for the needs of the Ukrainian army, IDPs and refugees.
